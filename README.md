**Public IP:** 4.210.213.40
**Port:** 2200
**Url:** http://ec2-34-210-213-40.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/toystores/

In order to deploy your application, you will need to configure your Lightsail VPS and secure it. 
## Login 
Launch the VPS either from the browser, within Lightrail, or via your own terminal **(Recommended)**

## Update the software

**Update**

```$ sudo apt-get update```
<br/>

**Upgrade**

```$ sudo apt-get upgrade```


## Create a New User and Give it Sudo Access

```$ sudo adduser {newuser}```

CD into the sudoers.d directory
<br/>
```$ cd /etc/sudoers.d```

Then create a new file named after the user you have created
<br/>
```$ sudo vim {newuser}```

Add the following to this new file 
<br/>
```{newuser} ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL```

## Set SSH Authentication

On your local machine, generate a new SSH key with ssh-keygen
<br/>
```ssh-keygen```
save this in the .ssh file on your local machine.

Back on your the VPS, change to the new user 
<br/>
```$ su - {newuser}```

Make a new directory, .ssh, and add the authorized_keys file **(Pro tip: Authorized NOT Authorised)** ðŸ‘Œ
<br/>
```$ mkdir .ssh```
<br/>
```$ touch .ssh/authorized_keys```
<br/>
```$ vim .ssh/authorized_keys```

Then set permissions with the Chmod command
<br/>
```$ chmod 700 .ssh```  _owner can read, write and execute_
<br/>

```$ chmod 644 .ssh/authorized_keys```  _owner can read, write_ 

Navigate to the sshd_config file and open with VIM or Nano
<br/>
```$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config```
Find the line PasswordAuthentication and change it from **yes** to **no**

Restart to run the new configurations
<br/>
```$ sudo ssh restart```

Now you can login as your new user with ssh
<br/>
```ssh -i ~/.ssh/{private-key-filename} {newuser}@52.24.125.52```

## Configure your firewall

```$ sudo ufc default deny incomming```
<br/>
```$ sudo ufw default allow outgoing```

## Configure the Ports 

Set the Firewall to only allow incoming connections for SSH port 2200, NTP port 123 and HTTP port 80
<br/>
```$ sudo ufw allow 2200/tcp```
<br/>
```$ sudo ufw allow 80/tcp```
<br/>
```$ sudo ufw allow 123/udp```
<br/>
```$ sudo ufw enable ```
